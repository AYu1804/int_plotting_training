# Interactive Plotting with R Short Course

The workshop will cover creating interactive graphs using plotly and echarts4r packages as well as the motivations behind using interactive graphs in reports and apps. It will go through the basic syntax of each package and how to create basic bar, scatter, and line graphs while customising the hover labels, legends, and themes. I will go through additional functionalities of each package, such as adding buttons, additional layers, and grouping/linkage between graphs. The session will have some basic exercises with optional additional challenges to create complex plots and render it using Rmarkdown.
